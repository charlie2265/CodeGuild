            Carlos Estévez was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City,[4][5] the youngest son of actor Martin Sheen (born Ramón
            Antonio Gerardo Estévez) and artist Janet Templeton.[6] His paternal grandparents were emigrants from Galicia
            (Spain) and Ireland, respectively.[7] His father is a "devout Catholic" and his mother is a "strict Southern
            Baptist".[8] Sheen has two older brothers, Emilio and Ramon, and a younger sister, Renée, all actors. His parents
            moved to Malibu, California, after Martin's Broadway turn in The Subject Was Roses. Sheen's first movie appearance
            was at age nine in his father's 1974 film The Execution of Private Slovik. Sheen attended Santa Monica High School
            in Santa Monica, California, along with Robert Downey, Jr., where he was a star pitcher and shortstop for the
            baseball team.[6][9]

            More about C.S. "Sheen's personal life has made headlines, including reports of alcohol and drug abuse and marital problems,
            as well as allegations of domestic violence. In March 2011, his contract for Two and a Half Men was terminated
            by CBS and Warner Bros. following his derogatory comments about the series' creator, Chuck Lorre.[3] On November
            17, 2015, Sheen publicly revealed that he is HIV positive, having been diagnosed about four years earlier."
